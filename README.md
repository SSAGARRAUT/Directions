# Directions Page
=================
<br/><br/>
This page uses the HTML5 Geolocation API to determine the location of the device accessing the page and then calculates directions from there to the location of the account. There is no custom controller necessary for this page to function properly, it just grabs necessary account details using the standard controller, and the Google Directions API to do the rest of the work.
